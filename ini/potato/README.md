# Low Spec Gaming Inspired Fallout3 (potato)

FYI - this is a royal pain :) the pipboy can toggle to solid colors and
make menuing impossible. Seeing some items on the ground is way easier
while other objects become impossible to see unless they have an interact
action pop up. Use at your own risk. GL
